#Hi, I’m Joel! 👋

I´m software engineer from Mexico 🇲🇽

Expert/passionate about the systems lifecycle, with over 20 years of experience. Throughout my professional career, I have had the opportunity and pleasure of being involved in each and every stage of a system's life. Planning, coding, construction, testing, versioning/storage, cloud deployment, operation, monitoring (cost optimization, maintenance, security, disaster recovery planning). Each of these parts is very interesting to me and presents an exciting challenge. Roles I have taken on include Software Architect, Technical Lead, Project Manager/Scrum Master, Agile Coach, Team Building (Recruiting/Talent Retention), Backend, Frontend, Full-stack, Database, DevOps, and QA, as well as system finances and costs. 🧗‍♂️

In addition, my soft skills (communication, resilience, motivation, negotiation, leadership) enforced with my technical expertise and not forgetting the extensive experience I have gained over time, I have discovered that the most important aspect is having properly trained and motivated individuals, working in suitable conditions. Proper guidance, continuous knowledge-building, empowering each team member, and providing security result in a motivated team with a sense of ownership and high productivity. This translates into success for any project undertaken. 🧑‍🚀

I have had the opportunity to learn about numerous tools, technologies, programming languages, frameworks, libraries, operating systems, and philosophies/methodologies during this journey. Some of my favorite ones are: Nodejs, PHP, Python, C++, Java/kotlin, GO, Angular, Vue, Reactjs, Mongodb, Mysql, Postgress, OracleDB, Jira, Azure Boards, Git, GitHub Actions, Azure Repos, Omniplan, MSProject, LEAN, Scrum, Kanban, Jest, Selenium, SonarQube, Microservices, Javascript, TypeScript, GraphQL, GCP, AWS, Azure Artifacts, Docker, kubernetes, Linux, MacOs, Jenkins, Pub/Sub, lambda/cloud functions, buckets/storage, elastic search, redis, grafana, Azure DevOps, hexagonal architecture, MVC, clean architecture, design patterns y IA. 🥷

I’m sure that this background also offers multiple opportunities to learn and acquire new knowledge and expertise.

How exciting! 🔥 Let's continue the journey! 🚀
